Results
=======

For my final test I ran 3 populations in parallel, if I had known before-hand
how many computers I would be able to get working for me I probably would have
used a few more populations to provide a more reliable set of results.

These populations were left to run for around 62 hours, unfortunately the first
population encountered an error after about 10 hours and stopped creating new
generations.

There are a few statistics that can be gathered from the resulting populations.
The first is the average and best score from each generation, see `Figure 2`__.

  Average and best scores against the generations.
  
In this we can see that the 


Other statistics that could be interesting is the size of the best algorithm in
each generation, see `Figure 3`__
