  abstract = "
    This study compared two alternative techniques for predicting forest cover
    types from cartographic variables. The study evaluated four wilderness
    areas in the Roosevelt National Forest, located in the Front Range of
    northern Colorado. Cover type data came from US Forest Service inventory
    information, while the cartographic variables used to predict cover type
    consisted of elevation, aspect, and other information derived from standard
    digital spatial data processed in a geographic information system (GIS).
    The results of the comparison indicated that a feedforward artificial
    neural network model more accurately predicted forest cover type than did a
    traditional statistical model based on Gaussian discriminant analysis."
