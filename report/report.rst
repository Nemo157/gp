:abstract: 
  This report details the implementation and testing of a genetic programming
  algorithm in Ruby with the goal of learning to predict forest cover
  types from a set of cartographic variables.  The plan for the development is
  covered, along with the major architectural changes that came about with the
  issues encountered.  The final results from three populations are overall
  classification accuracies of around 30%.
